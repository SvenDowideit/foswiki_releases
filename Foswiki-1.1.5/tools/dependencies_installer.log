WARNING: Could not write to "../working/logs/tools/dependencies_installer.log".
Using "./tools/dependencies_installer.log" instead.


Analysing environment...

Could not open file "../working/configure/pkgdata/".
Please verify read permissions. You may want to adjust group affiliation of the
current user. This could make sense if:
  1. You want to use this user for analysing the modules and maybe use sudo
     only later for module installation.
  2. You want to install from CPAN for a *local* CPAN installation.
In any other case, please invoke the script as root or use sudo initially.
